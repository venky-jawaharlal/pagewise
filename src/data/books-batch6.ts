    summary: [
      `Creative Confidence argues that everyone has the innate ability to be creative but most people have had it trained out of them by fear, self-doubt, and social pressure. Tom Kelley and his brother David Kelley, founder of IDEO and the Stanford d.school, share stories and strategies for rebuilding creative confidence through design thinking and experimentation.`,
      `The book combines inspiring stories from IDEO projects with practical techniques for overcoming creative blocks. From rapid prototyping to empathy-driven design, the Kelleys show how organizations and individuals can foster an environment where creative ideas flourish and get implemented.`,

      `The journey from casual audience to superfan follows a clear progression: casual, active, connected community, superfan.`,

      `The book is full of practical tactics for creating memorable moments, building genuine community, and making your audience feel seen and valued.

Zook and co-author James Allen show that companies lose these traits as they scale, leading to stall-outs.`,

      `To Sell Is Human argues that selling is no longer just for salespeople — everyone spends a significant portion of their time persuading, influencing, and moving others. Pink draws on social science research to show how the nature of selling has fundamentally changed in an era where buyers have as much information as sellers.`,
      `The book replaces the old approach of aggressive, information-asymmetry-based selling with a new framework built on attunement (seeing things from others' perspectives), buoyancy (staying afloat in a sea of rejection), and clarity (helping people see their problems in new ways). Pink provides practical techniques for pitching, improvising, and serving others in every persuasive interaction.`,

    keyTakeaways: [
      `People have no consistent internal sense of value — prices are heavily influenced by anchoring, framing, and context.`,
      `Anchoring is one of the most powerful forces in pricing and negotiation — the first number mentioned dominates all subsequent judgments.`,
      `Understanding pricing psychology gives you an enormous advantage in business, negotiation, and everyday purchasing decisions.`,
    ],
    summary: [
      `Priceless reveals that people are surprisingly irrational when it comes to determining what things are worth. Poundstone draws on decades of behavioral economics research to show how prices are shaped by anchoring effects, irrelevant comparisons, and clever framing. The book covers everything from why restaurant menus include absurdly expensive items to how real estate agents manipulate listing prices.`,
      `The book is both fascinating and practical, providing insights that apply to pricing products, negotiating salaries, understanding marketing tactics, and making better purchasing decisions. Poundstone shows that prices are not objective reflections of value but psychological constructions that can be understood and, when necessary, used to your advantage.`,
