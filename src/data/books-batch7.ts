    oneLiner: `A witty and fascinating tour of the human body that reveals how remarkable and mysterious our own biology truly is.`,
    keyTakeaways: [
      `The human body is an astonishing machine that performs millions of complex operations every second without conscious effort.`,
      `Modern medicine has made incredible progress, yet we still understand surprisingly little about basic bodily functions like sleep and pain.`,
      `Lifestyle choices around diet, exercise, and sleep have far greater impact on health outcomes than most pharmaceutical interventions.`,
    ],
    summary: [
      `The Body takes readers on a head-to-toe tour of human anatomy and physiology, blending science, history, and humor. Bryson explores how our organs, bones, and cells work together in extraordinary ways, while revealing how much remains unknown even to the world's top researchers.`,
      `From the microbiome to the immune system, Bryson shows that the body is far stranger and more wonderful than most people realize. The book also examines how modern lifestyles — processed food, sedentary habits, and chronic stress — are at odds with bodies that evolved for a very different world.`,

    keyTakeaways: [
      `Different obstacles to change — impulsivity, laziness, forgetfulness, confidence — require different evidence-based strategies to overcome.`,
      `Temptation bundling — pairing desired activities with necessary ones — is one of the most effective tools for building new habits.`,

      `How to Change synthesizes the latest behavioral science research to explain why change is hard and what actually works. Milkman identifies the specific internal barriers — temptation, procrastination, forgetfulness, lack of confidence, and conformity — and matches each with proven strategies.`,
      `The book is refreshingly practical, introducing tools like temptation bundling, commitment devices, fresh start effects, and copy-paste strategies. Rather than one-size-fits-all advice, Milkman helps readers diagnose their specific obstacle and choose the right intervention.`,

    oneLiner: `ADHD is not simply a genetic brain disorder but a developmental condition shaped by early emotional environments, and understanding this opens new paths to healing.`,
    keyTakeaways: [
      `ADD/ADHD originates not from genes alone but from the interaction between a sensitive nervous system and early emotional environments that fail to provide sufficient attunement.`,
      `The scattered mind is not defective but differently organized — highly sensitive, creative, and capable of intense focus when emotionally engaged.`,
      `Healing ADD requires addressing the underlying emotional and developmental wounds, not just managing symptoms with medication.`,
    ],
    summary: [
      `Scattered Minds challenges the purely biological model of ADD/ADHD, arguing that while genetics create predisposition, the condition develops in response to early emotional environments. Maté draws on his own experience with ADD, neuroscience research, and clinical observations to show that attunement — or lack thereof — in early relationships shapes the developing brain's attention systems.`,
      `The book reframes ADD not as a defect but as a different way of being in the world, shaped by sensitivity and early stress. Maté provides both a deeper understanding of the condition and practical approaches to healing that go beyond medication to address the emotional roots of scattered attention.`,

      `Go Wild extends Ratey's earlier work on exercise and the brain to encompass the full spectrum of evolutionary health. The book argues that nearly every modern epidemic — obesity, depression, anxiety, autoimmune disease — stems from the mismatch between our hunter-gatherer biology and our civilized lifestyle.`,
      `Ratey and co-author Richard Manning prescribe a return to wildness: not living in caves, but strategically reintroducing the physical, nutritional, social, and environmental conditions our bodies evolved to thrive in. From trail running and paleo-style eating to cold exposure and forest time, the book provides a comprehensive evolutionary health framework.`,

    oneLiner: `The reason most people fail at exercise is not laziness — it's that they've been taught to think about physical activity in exactly the wrong way.`,
    keyTakeaways: [
      `Framing exercise as a chore or punishment for eating creates negative associations that undermine long-term motivation.`,
      `Reframing physical activity as a gift — something that enhances your daily life right now — is the key to sustainable movement habits.`,
      `The best exercise is whatever you enjoy and will actually do consistently, not the most calorically efficient or intense option.`,
    ],
    summary: [
      `No Sweat challenges the conventional fitness industry approach of motivating people through guilt, weight loss goals, and intense workout programs. Segar's research shows that these approaches create negative associations with exercise that guarantee failure, and that a fundamental mindset shift is needed.`,
      `The book provides a framework for reframing physical activity from a should to a want by connecting it to immediate quality-of-life benefits — better mood, more energy, less stress. Segar shows that when people choose enjoyable activities and frame them as gifts rather than obligations, they create sustainable movement habits that last.`,
